                                        Established in January 1963 as Allied Guarantee Insurance Company, Inc., the company built a solid reputation in the general insurance landscape in the country. By 1989, it has been wholly owned by United Coconut Planters Life Assurance Corporation (Cocolife), and became the non-life insurance company arm of the UCPB Financial Services Group. In 2019, the company took another step forward and rebranded itself as Cocogen Insurance, with the goal of synergizing more with Cocolife. <br /><br />
                                        Cocogen offers a wide array of quality and innovative insurance solutions designed to protect everything a Filipino values, from tangible, hard-earned assets such as your home, business, and your car, to something as priceless as your loved ones and yourself.
